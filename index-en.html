    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>You have just been accepted into Mass Academy. Your goal is to make it
    to graduation as happy as possible by earning as many happiness points (hp)
    as you can.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To begin, select the number of players that will be participating. Each
    player then chooses a color to set their marker. Every player begins with
    20 hp.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Players roll the dice on their turn and depending on the square landed on,
    different things could happen:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Orange Square</p>
    <p>Each orange square contains either a positive or negative event that
    could happen to a Mass Academy student. When an orange square is landed on,
    a pop-up box will appear with the event and the number of points gained or
    lost.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Blue Square</p>
    <p>Like orange squares, blue squares contain events that could happen to a
    Mass Academy student. However, the number of points gained or lost can
    differ. When a blue square is landed on, a pop-up box will appear with the
    event and the dice. The player will gain or lose points depending on the
    number rolled. Some events are optional, in which the player can choose not
    to roll the dice. No points will be gained or lost.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Green Square</p>
    <p>Green squares are either weekends or summer break. Players will earn 5
    hp if they land on or pass a weekend square, and they will earn 10 hp if
    they land on or pass the summer break square.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: No players can share the same square. If a player's target square
    is occupied, the program will move the player to the next open square.</p>
