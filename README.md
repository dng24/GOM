# Game of MAMS

This is a parody of the Game of Life (the boardgame, not John Conway's version). Instead of having life events in the spaces, they are filled with things that could happen to a student at my high school, the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI. 

The game is available in English, Spanish, and French.
